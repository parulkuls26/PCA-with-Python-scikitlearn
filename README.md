# PCA with Python and scikit-learn

**Author:** Dr. Parul Kulshreshtha

## Description
This project demonstrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction using Python and scikit-learn. The analysis is performed on the breast cancer dataset, which contains 30 features from tissue samples classified as benign or malignant.

## Key Findings
- Reduced 30 features to 3 principal components
- 73% of variance retained with 3 components
- 95% of variance requires 10 components
- Clear separation between malignant and benign classes in 3D PCA space

## Libraries Used
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets.
